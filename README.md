# HMM Accessibility Macro

A simple macro built in python to help a twitch streamer.

## Explanation

Marcin, is a twitch streamer that can't play Heavy Metal Machines (a game developt by Hoplon) using all the buttons, due to a limitation.
Seeing his streams, some players had the idea to built a macro that would help him to use all the game skills without clicking the keyboard buttons.
So, I developt this macro.

## How does it Work

The macro just rotates using 3 buttons (Q, W, E, R) and press it if the player press the right button (the button that Marcin uses to cast the skills), so, basically this button
would rotate between all the game skills.
